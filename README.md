## üöÄ Overview

This repository showcases the work I undertook during my 6-month software internship at ERNET India. My responsibilities spanned full-stack development, automation, blockchain prototyping, AI/ML experimentation, and contribution to infrastructure planning for national IT projects.
The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate practical implementations of scalable, secure, and intelligent systems that solve real-world administrative and technical challenges.

## üß† Key Contributions

### 1. **Visitor Management System (VMS)**
- Built a prototype VMS with OCR-based ID scanning using Tesseract OCR and OpenCV.
- Integrated blockchain logging using Ethereum smart contracts for tamper-proof visitor data.
- Implemented anomaly detection using Python ML models to flag suspicious entries.
- Developed and executed manual test cases to ensure **functional accuracy** and **security compliance**.
- Debugged front-end and API-level errors to significantly improve system **stability** and **performance**.
- Technologies: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Flask, Firebase, Solidity, IPFS

### 2. **PDF & Excel Data Validation Automation**
- Automated extraction, validation, and cross-checking of 500+ legacy documents.
- Reduced manual effort by over 80% using Python (Pandas, PyMuPDF, OpenPyXL).
- Designed reusable scripts to parse tabular data, apply business rules, and generate reports.

### 3. **Blockchain Authentication System**
- Prototyped a login system using SHA-256 encrypted credential storage.
- Explored decentralization approaches for identity management in government systems.

### 4. **Data Centre Infrastructure Support**
- Analyzed blueprints and layout plans for a Tier-3 Data Centre project in Bengaluru.
- Contributed to the **Detailed Project Report (DPR)** focusing on technical infrastructure, power and cooling specs, and network architecture.

### 5. **Deployment & Tooling**
- Designed a **one-click Windows installer** using **Inno Setup scripting**, allowing seamless deployment of the VMS on fresh systems with zero pre-installation requirements.
- Simplified rollout process for non-technical users in government offices.
